# PCB Defect Detection using Computer Vision

This project aims to build an industrial-style computer vision system
for detecting defects on printed circuit boards (PCBs).

## Motivation
Automated visual inspection is critical in electronics manufacturing.
This project focuses on practical, deployable AI methods rather than
pure research.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Project Status
🚧 In progress – foundational setup
